Analyze the `DOHMH_NYC_Restaurant_Inspection.csv` data.

![](thumbnail.jpg)

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(skimr)
restaurant <- 
  read_csv('https://bcdanl.github.io/data/DOHMH_NYC_Restaurant_Inspection.csv')
```

#Q1a) 
What are the mean, standard deviation, first quartile, median, third quartile, and maximum of SCORE for each GRADE of restaurants?

```{r}
scorePerGrade <- restaurant %>% 
  group_by(restaurant$GRADE) %>%
  summarize(
    score_mean = mean(SCORE),
    score_sd = sd(SCORE),
    score_min = min(SCORE),
    score_q1 = quantile(SCORE, probs = .25),
    score_median = median(SCORE),
    score_q1 = quantile(SCORE, probs = .75),
    score_max = max(SCORE) )
```

#Q1b) 
How many restaurants with a GRADE of A are there in NYC? How much percentage of restaurants in NYC are a GRADE of C?

```{r}
numObs <- restaurant %>% 
  group_by(GRADE) %>% 
  summarize( number = n())
```

16305 with a grade of A

```{r}
294 / sum(numObs$number) * 100 
```

Percentage with grade C

#Q1c) 

Provide both (1) ggplot code and (2) a simple comment to describe how the distribution of SCORE varies by GRADE and CRITICAL FLAG.

```{r}
ggplot( data = restaurant) +
  geom_histogram(aes(x = SCORE, fill = restaurant$`CRITICAL FLAG`), bins = 50) +
  facet_grid(. ~ GRADE)
```

Critical makes up the majority of each grade, and those with the grade A
has the highest and most varied scores, those with grade C have much larger
scores

#Q1d) 
Provide both (1) ggplot code and (2) a simple comment to describe how the 
proportion of CRITICAL FLAG varies by GRADE and BORO.

```{r}
ggplot(data = restaurant) + 
  geom_bar(aes(x = GRADE, fill = BORO)) +
  facet_wrap(. ~ `CRITICAL FLAG`)
```

Staten Island and Bronx make up the smallest proportions of boroughs.  
Manhattan makes up the largest proportion of each grade. 
Critical and Not Critical have very similar distributions.

#Q1e) 
For the 10 most common CUISINE DESCRIPTION values, find the CUISINE 
DESCRIPTION value that has the highest proportion of GRADE A.

```{r}
cuiseDescrip <-  restaurant %>% 
  group_by(`CUISINE DESCRIPTION`) %>%
  summarise(count = n()) %>% 
  arrange(-count) %>% 
  mutate()

head(cuiseDescrip, 10)
```

#Q1f) 
Find the 3 most common names of restaurants (DBA) in each BORO.
If the third most common DBA values are multiple, please include all 
the DBA values.

```{r}
q2f <- restaurant %>% 
  select(DBA, BORO) %>% 
  group_by(BORO, DBA) %>% 
  summarize(n = n()) %>% 
  mutate(ranking = dense_rank(-n)) %>% 
  filter(ranking <= 3) %>% 
  arrange(BORO, ranking)

q2f_ <- restaurant %>% 
  group_by(DBA) %>% 
  count() %>% 
  arrange(-n)
```

#Q1g) 
For all the DBA values that appear in the result of Q1f, find the DBA 
value that is most likely to commit critical violation.
```{r}
q2g <- restaurant %>% 
  filter(DBA %in% q2f$DBA) %>% 
  group_by(DBA, `CRITICAL FLAG`) %>% 
  count() %>% 
  group_by(DBA) %>% 
  mutate(lag_n = lag(n),
         tot = sum(n),
         prop_crit = lag_n / tot) %>% 
  select(DBA, prop_crit) %>% 
  filter(!is.na(prop_crit)) %>% 
  arrange(-prop_crit)
```
