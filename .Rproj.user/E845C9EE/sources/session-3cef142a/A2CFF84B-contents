  summarize(
    score_mean = mean(SCORE),
    score_sd = sd(SCORE),
    score_min = min(SCORE),
    score_q1 = quantile(SCORE, probs = .25),
    score_median = median(SCORE),
    score_q1 = quantile(SCORE, probs = .75),
    score_max = max(SCORE) )
```

Q1b) How many restaurants with a GRADE of A are there in NYC?
