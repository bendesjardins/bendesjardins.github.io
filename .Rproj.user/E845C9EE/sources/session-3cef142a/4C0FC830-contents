#Q1a What are the mean, standard deviation, first quartile, median, third 
#    quartile, and maximum of SCORE for each GRADE of restaurants?

scorePerGrade <- restaurant %>%

#Q1b How many restaurants with a GRADE of A are there in NYC?
#     How much percentage of restaurants in NYC are a GRADE of C?

#Percentage with grade C

#Q1c Provide both (1) ggplot code and (2) a simple comment to describe how the 
#    distribution of SCORE varies by GRADE and CRITICAL FLAG.

ggplot( data = restaurant) +
  geom_histogram(aes(x = SCORE, fill = restaurant$`CRITICAL FLAG`), bins = 50) +
  facet_grid(. ~ GRADE)
#Critical makes up the majority of each grade, and those with the grade A
# has the highest and most varied scores, those with grade C have much larger
# scores

#Q1d Provide both (1) ggplot code and (2) a simple comment to describe how the 
#  proportion of CRITICAL FLAG varies by GRADE and BORO.

ggplot(data = restaurant) + 
  geom_bar(aes(x = GRADE, fill = BORO)) +
  facet_wrap(. ~ `CRITICAL FLAG`)
#Staten Island and Bronx make up the smallest proportions of boroughs.  
# Manhattan makes up the largest proportion of each grade. 
# Critical and Not Critical have very similar distributions. 

#Q1e For the 10 most common CUISINE DESCRIPTION values, find the CUISINE 
# DESCRIPTION value that has the highest proportion of GRADE A.
