Analyze the `NFL2022_stuffs.csv` data.

# Question 2
```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(skimr)
NFL2022_stuffs <- read_csv('https://bcdanl.github.io/data/NFL2022_stuffs.csv')
```

# Q2a
In data.frame, NFL2022_stuffs, remove observations for which values of posteam is missing.

```{r}
NFL2022_stuffs <- NFL2022_stuffs %>%
  filter(!is.na(posteam))
```


# Q2b
Summarize the mean value of pass for each posteam when all the following conditions hold:
  `wp` is greater than 20% and less than 75%;
  `down` is less than or equal to 2; and
  `half_seconds_remaining` is greater than 120.
```{r}
q2b <- NFL2022_stuffs %>% 
  filter(wp > .2 & wp <.75) %>% 
  filter(down <= 2) %>% 
  filter(half_seconds_remaining > 120) %>% 
  group_by(posteam) %>% 
  summarise(mean_pass = mean(pass))
```
  
# Q2c
Provide both (1) a ggplot code with geom_point() using the resulting data.frame in Q2b and (2) a simple comments to describe the mean value of pass for each posteam.
  In the ggplot, reorder the posteam categories based on the mean value of pass in ascending or in   descending order.

```{r}
q2c <- q2b %>% 
  arrange(desc(mean_pass))

ggplot(q2c) + 
  geom_point(aes(x = reorder(posteam, -mean_pass), y = mean_pass))
```

# Q2d
``` {r}
NFL2022_epa <- read_csv('https://bcdanl.github.io/data/NFL2022_epa.csv')

``` 
Create the data.frame, NFL2022_stuffs_EPA, that includes

All the variables in the data.frame, NFL2022_stuffs;
  The variables, passer, receiver, and epa, from the data.frame, NFL2022_epa. by joining the two    data.frames.
In the resulting data.frame, NFL2022_stuffs_EPA, remove observations with NA in passer.

```{r}
NFL2022_stuffs_EPA <- NFL2022_stuffs %>% 
  left_join(NFL2022_epa, by = "game_id")

NFL2022_stuffs_EPA <- NFL2022_stuffs_EPA %>%
  filter(!is.na(passer))
```

# Q2e
Provide both (1) a single ggplot and (2) a simple comment to describe the NFL weekly trend of weekly mean value of epa for each of the following two passers,
  `"J.Allen"`
  `"P.Mahomes"`

```{r}
passers <- c("J.Allen","P.Mahomes")
q2e <- NFL2022_stuffs_EPA %>% 
  filter(passer %in% passers) %>% 
  group_by(passer, week) %>% 
  summarise(mean = mean(epa))
  

ggplot(q2e, aes(x = week, y = mean, color = passer)) +
  geom_line() +
  geom_point()
```
Overall, P.Mahomes has a higher average EPA for most weeks of the NFL. J.Allen
has some of the lowest EPA's for each week. 

# Q2f

Calculate the difference between the mean value of epa for "J.Allen" the mean 
value of epa for "P.Mahomes" for each value of week.
```
